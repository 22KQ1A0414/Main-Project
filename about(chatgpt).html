            Refrigeration Appliances
             
            
            As the name suggests, refrigeration appliances enable us to store and preserve food items and beverages. We also use refrigeration appliances for cooling purposes like making ice cubes and ice creams. Apart from that, refrigeration appliances are also an integral part of cooking recipes that require instant freezing or frosting. Here is a list of products that should be on your home appliance list.
            
             
            
            Freezers
            Freezers are essential for preserving raw meats. Although most refrigerators have an attached freezer section, they are not capable enough for extensive requirements. For commercial purposes, it is recommended to go with heavy-duty freezers like Voltas CF HT 320 DD P Double Door Deep Freezer.
             
            
            Refrigerators
            There are hardly any households that don't know about the utilities of refrigerators. However, most people get confused between single-door, double-door and other types of refrigerators. It all depends on each household’s requirements and space availability.
            
             
            
            For homes with ample space, a multi-door refrigerator like Whirlpool 240 L Frost Free Multi-Door Refrigerator will work well.
             
            
            Water Coolers
            When the mercury goes up, nothing can be more soothing than sipping from a glass of cold water. You can store water bottles inside a fridge to cool them, but having a water cooler is more convenient as they directly dispense cooled water. Therefore, it is always on the home appliance list of offices.
            
             
            
            There are two types of water coolers – one that dispenses cooled water and the other that stores cold water. Voltas Mini Magic Pure-T is the best home appliance that can dispense both hot and cold water. On the other hand, Milton Kool Rover 12 is a more pocket-friendly appliance that comes with insulation, ideal for storing cold water.
            
             
            
             Ice Makers
            It is a simple home appliance used for making ice. An appliance like Ice the Matiic Ice Cube Maker is particularly designed for churning out ice cubes. It can be a crucial addition to the home appliances list of bars and restaurants..</p>
        
            Cooking Appliances
Cooking appliances always top the home appliances list of restaurants and eateries. Without the aid of cooking appliances, producing food on a large scale is next to impossible.

 

Kitchen Stoves
Even with the advent of many new-age ovens, kitchen stoves are still not replaceable. They use conventional gas burners to produce heat. They are easy to use and easy to clean. Products like Prestige IRIS LPG Gas Stove also looks neat and can add to the overall look of your kitchen.

 

Rice Cookers
The easiest way to cook rice is by using a rice cooker. Rice cookers top the home appliances list for almost all households and restaurants. 

 

Roti Makers
After the rice cooker, kitchen appliances like the Prestige Roti Maker and iBELL RM150 ROTI MAKER have become kitchen essentials. They are always on the home appliances list of homemakers and chefs.

 

Steamer Ovens
Steamer ovens are important cooking appliances to make certain kinds of recipes. If you are running a restaurant, having a steamer oven will lend you more creative liberty with your menu.

 

 Microwaves
Microwaves are probably the most used electric home appliances after gas ovens. Microwaves have tremendous versatility. You can cook, bake, and grill recipes using microwave ovens, and that is why it tops the home appliances list.
